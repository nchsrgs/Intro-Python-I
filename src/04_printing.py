"""
Python provides a number of ways to perform printing. Research
how to print using the printf operator, the `format` string 
method, and by using f-strings.

x = 10
y = 2.24552
z = "I like turtles!"

# Using the printf operator (%), print the following feeding in the values of x,
# y, and z:
# x is 10, y is 2.25, z is "I like turtles!"
print('X: %2d, Y:%5.2f, Z: %s' % (x, y, z))
# Use the 'format' string method to print the same thing
print('X: {0:2d}, Y: {1:2.2f}, Z: {2} '.format(x,y,z))

# Finally, print the same thing using an f-string
print(f'X: {x:2d}, y: {y:.2f}, Z: {z}')
